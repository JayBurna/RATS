# RATS
Run All The Scans

A small script to quickly/easily run common enumeration/scanning tools with a single command.

To-Do
-----

Add SQLMap and Hydra commands

Add some sort of menu or choice type system to select which tools to run each time it's run.

Added -dp and -ssl versions. -dp will launch the scans at a "different port", hence, the -dp .. and the -ssl version should be fairly obvious, will launch the scans targeted at ssl services, and adds an ssl-only scan.
